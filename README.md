## Gene Set Pathway Merging and Analysis
Starting fron one or more genes, extract from interaction databases the genes they interact with. Using the expanded gene set, perform pathway analysis and obtain all disease pathways in which the genes appear. Merge the pathways to obtain a larger graph. Perform further network analysis to extract central biomarkers and communities beyond pathways. Compute a distance between the initial gene set and the various pathways (diseases).
